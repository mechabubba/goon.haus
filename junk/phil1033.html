<h1><anchor id="sartre">Jean-Paul Sartre</anchor></h1>
<p><strong>Philosopher, existentialist.</strong> He wants us to express our radical freedom, saying its our nature to be free. Even further, Sartre believes that humans are special in that <a href="#sartre_condemned">we are condemned to be free.</a></p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Existence precedes essence.&quot; (292 - 293)
<ul>
<li>Man exists, and only later defines itself.</li>
<li><strong>Exception:</strong> When you invent something, you have the <em>idea</em> first (the essence), and only after you create it (the existence). Its usage, routines, etc. precedes its existence.
<ul>
<li>This is what makes us special; we define our legacy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;Human beings have a special kind of dignity.&quot;
<ul>
<li>Sartre believes we have this dignity beause we are so radically free - we can define ourselves, decide our essence, while other things cannot (rocks, animals, etc).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><anchor id="sartre_condemned">Sartre believes humans are &quot;condemned to be free&quot;.</anchor>
<ul>
<li>No matter what we do, we <em>choose</em> what we do (even if we don't choose, we <em>choose not to choose.</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Stress and anguish:</strong> We may feel these feelings before we make a decision, and may feel regret after we make a decision.</li>

<h2><anchor id="sartre_issues">Issues with Sartre's beliefs</anchor></h2>
<ul>
<li>Determinism
<ul>
<li>&quot;Whatever happens, <em>had</em> to happen given the causes that took place just the moment before.&quot; Popular view among scientists at the time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In cases where we are not choosing, are we <em>always</em> making a choice not to choose?
<ul>
<li>Described as <em>habitual behavior.</em> For example; if we are driving, playing a videogame, or doing something where we aren't paying attention to what we are doing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What don't we control?
<ul>
<li><strong>Desires</strong>
<ul>
<li>We can't just choose to like an activity that doesn't interest us.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Values</strong>
<ul>
<li>We may reject a set of values on the basis of a deeper set of values, but that just means we've already accepted said deeper set of values.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Facticity, or innate properties;</strong> wit, charm, coordination, etc.
<ul>
<li>We can try to be more charming than usual in the moment, but it won't always pan out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>&quot;If we're all free, then the free decisions of others would appear to interfere with our own (and vice versa).&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>Emmy Noether: Female college student in the 19th century, math genius. Faced an immense amount of obstacles to become a paid position at an American college.
<ul>
<li>She chose to do math and she wanted that to be her essence, but she was blocked to a great extent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Comedians: they may try to be funny but they may not be funny to everyone.</li>
<li>Male nannys: they may want to be one, but most people don't want to hire a male nanny.</li>

<h2><anchor id="sartre_realms">Extreme Sartre versus Moderate Sartre</anchor></h2>
<p>&quot;What about our height/eye color/other uncontrollable aspects?&quot;</p>
<h3><anchor id="sartre_realm_extreme">Extreme</anchor></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;Keep trying; it's all on you.&quot;</em></li>
<li>We decide who we are, almost completely.</li>
<li>&quot;If we dont succeed at crafting our chosen essence - because the world or other physical limitations get in our way - we can choose to be interested in some other goal instead, one that the outside world doesnt block.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Many of these have their objections, or are straight untrue.</strong> For example, Cavendish or Beauvoir just couldn't do anything to fit their essence, atleast in their time.
<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">It's important to note that extreme Sartre is correct about the importance of chasing our freedom, however he's mistaken to say that so much of our essence is up to our choice.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><anchor id="sartre_realm_moderate">Moderate</anchor></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;Well, sure.&quot;</em></li>
<li>Freedom may be super important, but it may be restricted in some cases.
<ul>
<li>&quot;We aren't in control of what we desire or what we value, but we are free to try to pursue what we <em>already</em> desire and value. And we better make sure to do that.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What should we do if our freedom is blocked?</strong> Moderate Sartre and Beauvoir both believed that <em>if we value freedom, we should fight against obstacles in the way of our own freedom.</em>
<ul>
<li>We should also use our current freedom to work toward freedom for everyone.</li>
<li>Eccentricity: bronies, trekkies, etc...
<ul>
<li>In Sartres eyes, they are locating their &quot;Sartreian freedom&quot; and acting on it; he says sometimes this may result in them being seen as a little weird.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the end, Sartre acknowledges his limitations; &quot;There are limits to the essences we can achieve, but as long as we pick stuff that we do well, that we care about deeply, and that the world does not completely block, we will have a life of meaning, so long as we put in the effort.&quot;</li>

<h1><anchor id="beauvoir">Simone de Beauvoir</anchor></h1>
<p>Life partner of Sartre, writer, and woman.</p>
<h1><anchor id="cavendish">Margaret Cavendish</anchor></h1>
<p><strong>Author and woman.</strong> Lived in 1650s England for much of her life.</p>
<ul>
<li>Was royalty, but wrote/advocated for equality between men and women aswell as philosophy.</li>
<li><strong>What should we do if our freedom is blocked?</strong> Cavendish thinks an outlet is to write science fiction.
<ul>
<li>We should create alternate worlds that are more hospitable to our desires; worlds that are different than the real world and eliminate the obstacles that block us from doing what we want to do.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><anchor id="cavendish_texts">Texts</anchor></h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Blazing World:</em> &quot;The Lady&quot; is sailing on a boat through the north pole, and gets kidnapped; being brought from world to world until she finds her final world filled with unusual animal-like creatures. She fears these creatures at first, but she starts to engage with them; they are scientists and engage/value her contributions to their society and science. She writes back to earth through time and space, telling and inviting the researchers there of her discoveries, only to be thrown aside and scorned because there was a woman involved. In the end she works with these creatures alone to defeat their enemy.</li>
<li><em>Bell in Campo:</em> In the real world, women do not hold powerful positions and are in general not taken seriously. Cavendish creates an alternate world in which women are taken more seriously. In this world, Lady Victoria forms a body of five or six thousand women, and assists the men in their country in a war; fighting until &quot;the jaws of death&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="#top">Jump to top</a></strong></p>
<h1><anchor id="plato">Plato</anchor></h1>
<p><strong>Author and philosopher.</strong> Lived in ancient Athens; author of Euthypro. <span class="trans">Plato isn't actually his name; it's just a stage name.</span></p>
<h1><anchor id="socrates">Socrates</anchor></h1>
<p>Socrates annoyed people.</p>
<p>Main character in Euthypro. Seen as a disruptor; goes around his local town posing a lot of fundamental questions (socratic dialogues).</p>
<ul>
<li>He ends up being popular around the youngsters, because he goes around asking the adults and the people making the laws whether they're good or not (he exposes pretty quickly that they dont know what they're doing).</li>
<li>Socrates teaches us that questions of morality and value are objective (meaning, the questions are factual and can be proven true or false). One question in this endeavor is about the origins of good and bad and right and wrong, aswell as whether there is an <em>infinitely powerful being</em> at the start of the universe (typically known as God, but will hereon be known as the <abbr title="Infinitely Powerful Being">IPB</abbr>).</li>
</ul>
<h2><anchor id="euthypro">Euthypro</anchor></h2>
<p>Oh christ, here we go.</p>
<p>The text guides us saying that Euthypro is prosecuting his father, coming as a shock to Socrates. He says that insted of getting preferential treatment, justice should be blind; the people who do bad should get punished and the people who do good should get rewarded. Socrates says that because he is an expert about doing the right thing, he should give a definition of what is good.</p>
<p>Euthypro says, <em>&quot;The pious is to do what I am doing now, to prosecute the wrongdoer, be it about murder or temple robbery or anything else, whether the wrongdoer is your father or your mother or anyone else; not to prosecute is impious.&quot;</em> Socrates badgers him some more, and eventually Euthypro gives an adequate statement of what is good; <span class="highlight"><em>&quot;...the pious is what all the gods love, and the opposite, what all the gods hate, is impious.&quot;</em></span></p>
<p>Socrates argues that the definitions of good/bad/right/wrong is not up to God.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;If God does not decide the definition of goodness, then that definition exists whether God exists or not, and God does not need to exist in order for there to be such a thing as a good or valuable (or meaningful) life.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking a step back. Socrates believes that there are two scenarios;</p>
<ul>
<li>There exists the IPB at the start of the universe, but there are <em>not yet any truths about good and bad, right and wrong.</em>
<ul>
<li>Socrates worries that since this is how good and bad arises, good and bad would be random or arbitrary. Morality is not like that; it is not random.</li>
<li>He therefore argues that this scenario cannot be right; &quot;On what basis would it decide?&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There exists the IPB at the start of the universe, and <em>there also exists truths about what is good and bad, right and wrong.</em>
<ul>
<li>The IPB could add onto those definitions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These scenarios lead to two different theses, with their own worries;</p>
<ul>
<li>The IPB loves things, <em>because they are good <span class="trans">already</span>.</em>
<ul>
<li>As stated earlier, randomness and arbitrariness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Things are good, <em>because the IPB <span class="trans">already</span> loves them.</em>
<ul>
<li>God is not the author of everything.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><anchor id="socrates_morality">Socrates on Morality and Good</anchor></h3>
<p>As written, there are issues on both sides. One case of where morality comes from is that it can vary from society to society, based on different factors and influences;</p>
<div class="note blue">
<em>"There are no <strong>facts</strong> about what is good/bad/right/wrong; moral codes evolve in a way to help each society survive. When different societies have different moral codes, it doesnt mean any moral code is correct; it just means that different societies have different needs."</em> — Week 4 Lecture 1
</div>
<p>Socrates says this is a part, but not the whole of the origin of morality. He believes that the idea of good and morality is permenant; not only that, but it is independent of God. Had it changed, it would change on no basis; it would be random. <span class="highlight">Socrates believes that nothing decides what is good - it is independent of everything, fixed and permenant.</span></p>

<h2><anchor id="apology">Apology</anchor></h2>
<p>Perhaps better translated as &quot;defense&quot;, in Apology, Socrates is on trial and attempts to defend himself from several charges; &quot;corrupting the youth, atheism, making the weaker argument the stronger&quot; are noted, as well as sophism. He has gotten this reputation by asking questions. In context, Socrates has learned from a Delphi oracle that he has been named the smartest person alive.</p>
<p>In response to this, he doubts it and instead goes to ask questions of people - among reputed people - to see if they have more knowledge than he. He's trying to confirm or deconfirm the oracles thesis. He ends up with the conclusion that he understands that he <em>doesn't</em> know everything, while other people may not - they may think they know <em>everything</em>. In general, Socrates is <strong>asking questions.</strong> No one has time to criticize, question, or try to improve certain aspects of life, so thats what he's doing. He's going aorund exposing people.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soda Can Analogy:</strong> Imagine your roommate or someone close to you says they couldnt finish a can of soda so they left it for you somewhere; you'd probably be willing to finish that soda. But if you saw one sitting on the ground, you may not feel the same way; there may be danger that didnt exist otherwise.</li>
<li>&quot;In a similar way, when we're born into a society, we absorb the practices and traditions and values of that community. In a way, thats dangerous, because we never had an opportunity to critique them or check them out. What we need to do as adults is to examine them; if we see that they are problematic, corrupt or dangerous, we need to purge them from our system and only accept the practices or traditions that are valuable.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Socrates says that the way to figure out what in society is good is to <em>live the examined life.</em> We need to live na examined life to figure out what is good, and then apply that to our own lives. He says that <strong>we need as many people as possible to live examined lives; every second.</strong> When we don't, we are merely amateurs.</p>
<div class="note blue" id="socrates_unexamined">
<em>"The unexamined life is not worth living."</em> — Socrates
</div>
<p>Socrates then says that instead of being convicted, he should be freed because he is doing a service to the Gods and the city in particular, because he'll uncover some super problematic practices and argue for their change/removal.</p>
<h3><anchor id="apology_horse">Horse-breeder Analogy</anchor></h3>
<p>If you had a bunch of unguided, amateur horse breeders, they would only hurt the horses. Its only the professionals (a very small number of people) who will do a good job taking care of the horses.</p>
<ul>
<li>In context, Socrates is calling the majority of Athens (teachers, parents, doctors, lawyers, politicians...) the amateurs. He says that they walk around like they're the authority on where they as a society they should go. They perpetuate the same traditions from the previous generations into the next generation, but they dont have expertise to consider why they're doing it and if it should be changed. They just want to get on with their lives, and as amateurs, will get it wrong 90% of the time.</li>
</ul>
<p>He refers to himself not as a professional, but more as a horsefly, simply annoying the amateurs to solve problems in society.</p>
<h3><anchor id="apology_mindbody">Mind-Body Dualism</anchor></h3>
<p>Socrates argues that our mind is the <em>special</em> half of us, and that its more important; it should be <em>emphasized.</em> The mind can pursue perfection; for example, you can imagine a perfect circle or a perfect triangle, something you could not realize in the physical realm (see the second periodic table). Spiritual activity is more important than our physical half.</p>
<p>At the end of the sentences, the verdict is that Socrates is sentanced to death.</p>
<p>Socrates really annoyed people.</p>
<h3><anchor id="apology_afterlife">Socrates on the Afterlife</anchor></h3>
<p>Socrates says hes not worried about the afterlife - even to the point that the afterlife is superior to current life. He believes that if minds and bodies are different, and our minds and spirits arent produced by our brains at all, when we die, there wouldn't be any impact on our continued existence - we may just continue on. He'd just continue to do philosophy as normal. Even better; if all who have died are there, he'd be able to think with and discuss philosophy with other great thinkers; Orpheus, Hesiod, Homer, etc. &quot;The afterlife is concieved of something where we dont have the shackles or limitations of a body; superior to an embodied life. We have a spirit thats more powerful than a body; why not get started already on a spiritual life of thinking?&quot;</p>

<p>Slightly off topic; Socrates believes in two reasons to emphasize spiritual activity in examined lives;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;To critically evaluate our values, customs, and traditions.&quot;</em></li>
<li><em>&quot;The value of thinking/questioning in general.&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>These values are intertwined. Socrates believes that the best society is one where we get rid of traditions/values/customs based on the body; gladiatorial fights, posession of material things, etc. The most important thing is acquiring knowledge, interacting/communicating with other people and their spirits, valuing people for their personality over looks, etc.</p>
<p>...anyway. Socrates is on his deathbed and makes the claim; &quot;I am afraid that other people do not realize that the one aim of those who practice philosophy in the proper manner is to practice for dying and death.&quot;</p>
<p>What does Socrates think we ought to be doing with our time?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perfection vs imperfection:</strong> Bodies are always flawed in various ways, but our minds can come up with perfect ideas and thoughts.
<ul>
<li>The exact equalities in math, perfectly straight lines, circles, idealizations, etc...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Because of this, we should start to spend our time thinking inwardly; <em>thinking about these perfect ideas and turning away from thinking about imperfect ideas like bodies and other physical things, even going so far to say that we must change our society to this way of thinking.</em> Socrates calls physical, imperfect ideas a distraction, and encourages us to recognize that we will be much happier if we follow his idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>Socrates agrees with Sartre by saying that we are clearly in control of our decisions and choices - we have free choice - but he says that if we have freedom, our minds are clearly not physical things.</p>
<h3><anchor id="phaedo_harp">Harp Analogy</anchor></h3>
<p>Consider an objection to these ideas. A friend of Socrates says that there are certain objects that have the same opposite features as mind and body, but they're all physical. He points to the Harp.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you play music on a harp, the notes are invisible and individable - intangible. Still, they are physical, because they are produced by the harps strings - when you stop plucking the strings, the music stops playing. When the strings are broken, the notes are destroyed.</li>
</ul>
<p>From moment to moment, the music points its entire existance to the movement of the strings. If these decisions or thoughts were determined from our &quot;brain strings&quot;, the decisions and thoughts we make would come from the state of the &quot;brain strings&quot; the moment before - <strong>no free will.</strong></p>
<p>Socrates flips the argument on its head by saying that our ideas/minds/thoughts are NOT caused by our brain firings; saying that we clearly have some kind of free choice, and that our minds are clearly the more noble part of us. This enhances his idea of &quot;mind body dualism&quot;.</p>
<!--
- "The ability to do otherwise": A central aspect of free choice; having the possibility open to make a different choice. If decisions from moment to moment were decided by our brain strings, its the decision we *had* to make; theres no other choice we could've made.
-->
<p>We get closer to Socrates idea of what is good, but not all the way. We don't have an exact defintion, but Socrates argues that an important component of the idea is <em>mental and spiritual activity, and living a life that focuses on such.</em></p>
<h2><anchor id="socrates_objections">Objections to Socrates</anchor></h2>
<p><strong>&quot;There is strong evidence that our minds/spirits <em>are</em> entirely physical.&quot;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cavendish and Mind-body interaction: our minds actually <em>are</em> able to come into contact with our bodies. &quot;I'm going to decide to my arm to go up, and it goes up!&quot; Therefore, our minds are interacting with our physical body and must be physical.</li>
<li>General anesthesia: The anesthesiologist numbs our neuron activity; when that happens, thinking stops.</li>
</ul>
<!-- @todo Cavendish offers a number of examples here. See the lecture notes. -->
<p><strong>&quot;Perhaps there are no perfect entities <span class="trans">(like perfect circles)</span> in the way that Socrates proposes.&quot;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To clarify; maybe the perfect shapes that we imagine are imperfect. If so, focusing our attention on imperfect things would be just fine; that's all there is, after all.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&quot;A disembodied life <span class="trans">(even if Socrates is right, and also a life in which we turn our attention away from bodies and toward spiritual activities)</span> would be alien and disorienting.&quot;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Everything that we do in life <em>currently</em> involves the body somehow. Talking to friends, exercising, singing, etc.
<ul>
<li>In the afterlife, this would not be an objection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If we turned away from this and lived a life that emphasizes the spirit and ignores our physical side might actually feel pretty meaningless; we'd be turning our back to all the physical stuff that means so much to us. We are only human, after all; not yet a pure spirit or in the afterlife.</li>

<h1><anchor id="wolf">Susan Wolf</anchor></h1>
<p>Distinguished professor at the University of North Carolina. Unlike everyone before her, she is still alive! :D</p>
<h2><anchor id="wolf_meanings">&quot;The Meanings of Lives&quot;</anchor></h2>
<p>A paper by Susan Wolf.</p>
<!-- 
### misc notes: meaningful lives and an element on the periodic table 2
periodic table #2: wolf believes that there are some things that do not exist on the traditional periodic table; not necessarily as many things as socrates would put on though

"if all that exists is on periodic table #1, there is no meaning of life because *value doesn't exist.*"
- she thinks value *does* exist... on the second periodic table. we incorporate it in our lives when we live meaningful lives.
-->
<p>Wolf starts her paper off with the stereotypical &quot;What is the meaning of life?&quot;, but framed as a question <em>of</em> the question. Its a bit vague... the question is not very percise and has lost a bit of credibility due to it being asked ad hominem over the years.</p>
<p>The question is often connected to &quot;God&quot; or some creator - for example, people asking what their meaning is on earth, what they're serving for God, etc - which would involve proving God exists, and which specific God if any. She doesn't answer this question.</p>
<p>She says there isnt a single answer to the question for all of us; rather, there are many different &quot;lives of meaning&quot; people can lead. For each individual, there are only a small number of lives they can live, but across the planet, there are many - billions. Shes not only trying to answer the &quot;meanings of lives&quot;, but also what the ingredients of a life of meaning are.</p>
<h2><anchor id="wolf_criteria">Wolfs Criteria of Living a Meaningful Life</anchor></h2>
<h3><anchor id="wolf_blob">The Blob</anchor></h3>
<p><strong>Do activities in which you're actively engaged in what you're doing.</strong></p>
<p>This is a very extreme case of a life we want to avoid. In her example, the person is watching the television in &quot;a hazy passivity&quot;; watching some show that they don't care much about. The content, good or bad, doesn't matter for the person; they are too lazy to change the channel regardless. What they're doing doesn't matter to them.</p>
<p>This is different from someone whos <em>actively watching</em> television or a movie. Wolf says its not about <em>what</em> we're doing, but <em>how</em> we're doing it.</p>
<h3><anchor id="wolf_useless">The Useless</anchor></h3>
<p><strong>Do activities of which you regard as having value, which is worth sticking to, or which is not discardable.</strong></p>
<p>Described as a project or pursuit that <em>we</em> regard as having value, but not many elsewhere. Think of it as a life wholly occupied with silly activity; someone like an idlee rich person who flits about and doesn't really do anything substantial to society; for example, shopping, travelling, etc.</p>
<h3><anchor id="wolf_bankrupt">The Bankrupt</anchor></h3>
<p>Also known as Successful Engagement; <strong>Do activities in which you are successful at.</strong></p>
<p>Someone whos met the first two criteria - actively engaged and regards an activity as having value - but still who isnt living a life of meaning because they aren't successful; a failure, someone who doesn't achieve results.</p>
<p>Wolf admits that this criteria is a bit more controversial; for example, someone who lost to finding the cure to cancer isn't necessarily a failure as they may have mentored many students and made some less promenant discoveries. She says that this criteria isn't an all or nothing criteria. <em>&quot;No ones life is going to be fully bankrupt.&quot;</em></p>
<h3><anchor id="wolf_fourth">The Fourth Criteria</anchor></h3>
<p><strong>Do activities that <em>actually</em> have value.</strong></p>
<p>Doing something that matters to society. For example, serial killers. They believe their lives have meaning, but obviously it doesn't have any <span class="trans">(good)</span> meaning to society. Wolf says we can't totally be sure when we meet the fourth criteria, but we can get pretty close.</p>
<h3><anchor id="wolf_postnote">In the end...</anchor></h3>
<p>Wolf admits that for these four &quot;ingredients&quot;, people will meet a meaningful life in different ways; its very malleable, persay.</p>
<p>Just because something doesn't mean all three criteria doesn't mean to not do it; Wolf says that there should be times for <em>some</em> less meaningful, silly or frivolous activities. She explains further that if everything in our life had extreme meaning, it'd be a pretty heavy/intense life. We need time to relax.</p>
<p>Wolf also says that a meaningful life does not necessarily equal a happy life. A trip to your birthplace may be meaningful, but its not as fun as going to an amusement park persay. However, our meaningful activities are active across all four criteria.</p>
<p>On god (on god?), she says that to secure meaning in an activity its the <em>same procedure,</em> whether God exists or not. She even starts her paper with saying that she won't try to prove God exists because she doesn't think she can; rest assured, we can still live lives of meaning regardless of their existence.</p>
<p>Finally, Wolf agrees with Socrates in saying that theres a fact of the matter of what is good and bad, right and wrong; some ways of living are more worthwhile than others, and some are just a waste of time.</p>
<h2><anchor id="wolf_objections">Objections to Wolf</anchor></h2>
<p><strong>&quot;Wolf has not proven that there is objective value.&quot;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Her response: So what? She says she's still correct; her recipe is still correct, its just that one of the ingredients doesn't exist.
<ul>
<li>Dino-Sandwich: A dino-sandwich consists of bread, lettuce, tomato, and dino. If we can't find dino meat, that doesn't mean the recipe is incorrect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&quot;Still, if we cant meet the fourth critereon, we can't really apply Wolf's view. History shows that in any particular case we <em>might</em> be deluded.&quot;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wolf says that there is no way to prove once and for all that we are in possession of the fourth ingredient — but we can still do the best we can.</li>
<li>We can also avoid being &quot;willfully obtuse;&quot; we can leave our community, talk to other people, and consider other points of view to check if we're meeting the fourth critereon.</li>

<h1><anchor id="frankfurt">Harry Frankfurt</anchor></h1>
<p>Distinguished professor at Princeton University. Like Wolf, is alive. Author of &quot;On Bullshit&quot;.</p>
<h2><anchor id="frankfurt_bullshit">On Bullshit</anchor></h2>
<p>In this text, Frankfurt worries that in many cases, human beings are born into the world and buy into values and build our lives on them - but if we stepped back and looked at them, we'd see that they're bullshit. To lead a full life, we need to step back and take a look at our desires and motivations to see if it will lead to a fulfilling and meaningful life. <a href="#socrates_unexamined">This is similar to the beliefs of Socrates.</a></p>
<p>The traditional definition of whats unique and distinctive about a person is that they have not only a body but a <em>mind</em> (the belief of Socrates). Frankfurt says that this is not entirely correct; many beings have minds and bodies, for example cats and dogs. <span class="highlight">Frankfurt says that what makes humans what we are are &quot;desires of the second order&quot;.</span></p>
<div class="note">
For all intents and purposes, an <strong>inclination</strong> is a weak desire, and a <strong>volition</strong> is a very strong desire - something that we characteristically act on, where our heart is in it.
</div>
<h2><anchor id="frankfurt_desires">Desires</anchor></h2>
<p>Frankfurt gives us different definitions for types of desire.</p>
<h3><anchor id="frankfurt_desires_first">First Order Desire</anchor></h3>
<p>We kinda know when we have these; a natural force that kinda pushes and pulls us. This can be anything; desires to be kind, desires to eat pizza, to be a doctor, to smoke, to fight, to <em>not</em> fight, etc. Can vary in strength - Frankfurt sees them all as on a spectrum (from 0 to 100, perhaps).</p>
<h3><anchor id="frankfurt_desires_second">Second Order Desire</anchor></h3>
<p>Where what we want is a desire in itself, the object of our desire <em>is</em> a desire - such as, &quot;I wish I had a desire. I wish I wanted... I wish I didn't want...&quot; We're taking a step back and taking a stand on which desires we wish motivated us. Instead of taking a desire at face value, we're asking if there are desires that would be more desirable or suitable for us - simply saying, take desires that don't suit us well, and get rid of them in place of desires that are <em>more</em> suitable for us. <span class="trans">As Sartre would say, not so easy!</span> These desires can also vary in strength. Without second order desires, your life may feel empty.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>second order inclination</em> is a desire for a weak desire; likewise, a <em>second order volition</em> is a desire for a very strong desire.</li>
<li>There are some further precise levels of desires that exist, but they are moot in the course; a weak desire for a weak desire, a strong desire for a strong desire, a weak desire for a strong desire, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Second order desires distinguish us from other people and cause us to be big motivators.</p>
<h2><anchor id="frankfurt_fuss">What The Fuss Is About</anchor></h2>
<p>Frankfurt is focusing on the notion of &quot;crafting a life&quot;; we want to be in charge of our lives and who and what we are, and the more in charge we are, the more we'll get out of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>A life that fulfills us is that we have a good number of desires, and they are more fulfilling and grand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Frankfurt says that we never had any say or control in what desires we had, but they have had a great amount of control over us and our lifes trajectory. He says it'd be much better if we had control over our desires, that we'd have a greater say of what our lives are. Some desires are just more desirable to have. As we couldn't do this before we were born, the next best thing is to develop our desired desires now.</p>
<h3><anchor id="frankfurt_wanton">The Wanton</anchor></h3>
<p>A character in On Bullshit. This character is lazy - not a full blown entire laziness, but lazy just about having second order desires; they are <strong>indifferent</strong> to what desires motivate them.</p>
<p>Frankfurt has in mind that this character is lazy about stepping back and evaluating what desires it has. A wanton is not a person - they are their own. Still, the wanton can still deliberate and have goals and <em>actively pursue</em> their goals.</p>
<p>The idea of Extreme Sartre consistently comes up; we can't <em>directly control</em> our desires, but we can take indirect steps to develop the desire. For example, if we desire the desire to go to the gym, we can go with a friend for a few months and then eventually build up the desire to go to the gym by ourselves, even if the friend isn't available.</p>
<div class="note">
<strong>Freedom of Action:</strong> The ability to <em>do what we want to do.</em> A first order notion.<br>
<strong>Freedom of Will:</strong> The ability to <em>control what our motivations are.</em> A second order notion. Frankfurt says this is a very noble freedom that we will only have in certain situations.
</div>
<h2><anchor id="frankfurt_applications">Applications of Frankfurt's View</anchor></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher satisfaction desires:</strong> Somebody who just fulfills the desires that come to them will feel a level of satisfaction, but exposing yourself to more fulfilling desires can give you a higher satisfaction.</li>
<li><strong>Pruning:</strong> In current day, we're all doing many things at the same time; we're spreading ourselves very thin and may not get milage on many projects. We can prune our less meaningful desires so we can avoid this and get more satisfaction and meaning in our lives.</li>
<li><strong>Ethics:</strong> You may not feel the desire to do something, however when you seek the desire to apply, you tend to think good/moral things. <!-- @todo clarify? --></li>
</ul>
<h2><anchor id="frankfurt_objections">Objections to Frankfurt</anchor></h2>
<p><strong>Extreme conception of personhood:</strong> &quot;Are we really not a <em>person</em> if we dont step back and look at what desires we want? Is a wanton olympion not human?&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Frankfurt would probably accept this.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&quot;Where do second order desires come from?&quot;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>He says that we don't have any say over first order desires, and that we should question them. Where do desires of the second order come from? Should we assess them as well, or should we just accept them at face value?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&quot;Are we automatically driven by our strongest desire?&quot;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Frankfurt offers a pretty simplistic view of our mental life, defining our desires as those that characteristically drive our behavior. Yet, while we may have very strong desires, there are cases when we can say no to them.</li>
<li>Frankfurt responds by saying that sure, a small portion of the time we're in a reflective mode where we can notice a very strong desire we're about to act on and say no. But most of the time, we're not thinking that deliberately and the desire wins out.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&quot;Coming to have a new desire is far more difficult than Frankfurt suggests with his chemical example.&quot;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chemical example:</strong> A physician could do a weak desire to do a drug by inserting a small amount of the drug into his system. This is not an important case; in the real world, developing a desire toward something mundane such as studying or working out is a lot more difficult than just injecting a drug.</li>

<h1><anchor id="heidegger">Martin Heidegger</anchor></h1>
<p>German philosopher and writer from the 1960s.</p>
<h2><anchor id="heidegger_worries">Worries about Technology</anchor></h2>
<p>Heidegger worries that as a result of being surrounded by technology and all these things that instantly gratify us, we start to develop very strong first order desires to/for them. He says specifically that we get strong desires to only do things that can be done quickly, to pat a lot of attention to machines (as Cunning said, being distracted from the real life), and to move on to the next thing on our list. We <em>expect</em> gratification, for the world to be on call for us.</p>
<p>Heidegger questions if we really want to be the kind of person to only do things quickly, to be <em>impatient</em>, to be so into our machines that its hard to focus on true interactions with other people. More deeply, he worries if we had any <em>say</em> to these desires; if we could have avoided them.</p>
<div class="note">
<strong>Important note:</strong> He doesn't hate technology; he loves the convenience but he believes that there are a lot of negative aspects of technology that we should be aware of.
<div class="break"></div>
<p>A point he brings up is that there is simply something that pre-technological folks had that we lack (techné); likewise, we have something that pre-technological folks lack (medicines, the internet, etc). He is saying that we need to strike a balance.</p>
<div class="break"></div>
<p>He's also not judging us, he catches himself in moments of impatience aswell. He just thinks that there are/should be moments that are sacred that we should be &quot;tuned into.&quot;</p>
</div>
<p>He regards technology as neutral; the way technology is <em>used</em> causes it to be good or bad. We need to consider the impact that it has on us.</p>
<h3><anchor id="heidegger_correctness">On correctness: &quot;Correct&quot; versus &quot;True&quot;</anchor></h3>
<p>Heidegger says that correctness means the accurateness of something, and trueness means the complete account of something. He says that its correct to say that technology is a human activity, and also that its a &quot;means to an end&quot;, in that it helps us reach the goals we have. The above statement is correct, but its not <em>true.</em></p>
<p>Another example is of a drug dealer saying they work in pharmaceuticals; its not <em>wrong,</em> but its definitely not <em>true.</em></p>
<h3><anchor id="heidegger_cause">The Four Different Kinds of Cause</anchor></h3>
<p>Heidegger says that anytime anyone makes anything, or anytime something gets produced, there are four different types of cause that go into it. These are all <em>required;</em> If theres just us and an idea, but no material, we couldn't make it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Material:</strong> The <em>stuff</em> that something is made of; wood, stone, brick, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Formal:</strong> An idea or blueprint, a plan.</li>
<li><strong>Final:</strong> The purpose or goal that inspires said idea. This cause represented by the &quot;telos&quot;; interpreted in the class as the &quot;purpose&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>Us:</strong> Us. We're the ones with the ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p>These four causes are the ways of being responsible. For example, if we have a silver chalice, the silver is co-responsible; its not the only thing, but it played a role.</p>
<p><strong>Poesis</strong> (noun) — &quot;The process of creation or production, on its own (slow, unhurried) time.&quot; Theres two categories of poesis;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physis</strong> (noun) - &quot;The process of production <em>in nature:</em> for example, the blossoming of a plant.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Techné</strong> (noun) - &quot;The process of production <em>by human beings;</em> mainly creative activity. For example, when a human creates a piece of art or a craftsperson creates a specialized part.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2><anchor id="heidegger_worlds">Heidegger and Worlds</anchor></h2>
<p>A world to Heidegger isn't a planet; rather, its a set of activities within a group of common minded people. Examples are the &quot;art world&quot;, the &quot;world of sports&quot;, etc. It can take a good amount of time to get involved or immersed in a world.</p>
<p>We all know what its like to inhabit a world; it can be a club on campus, comic-con, or even a family. A good metric for it is that if theres a magazine or established online community for it. Heidegger worries that as technology advances and as we get more impatient, it can get harder and harder to get into &quot;worlds&quot; perse; as it can take a while for us to get immersed into them it may seem to us that its not worth it to do so. Its like a magic eye poster; it takes us a while to see what they represent, but once we see it we're in. The only worlds we'll involve ourselves with are worlds that involve immediate gratification, ones that have &quot;quick fixes&quot;</p>
<p>To put it another way, Heidegger says that we have a muscle that allows us to be patient and that allows us to &quot;see significance&quot;. If we're immersed in technology, this muscle will atrophy or weaken, and we'll really struggle to be interested.</p>
<div class="note">
<em>Heidegger is no environmentalist;</em> he is not worried about the damage we do to nature. He is instead worried about when we create machines to extract as much as possible out of nature as fast as possible, theres an unexpected effect on us and our expectations. We get used to the gratification and efficiency, and we come to expect it; we don't settle for anything less.
</div>
<div class="note cyan">
It should also be stated, as to paint the entire picture, that Heidegger is antisemetic, having lived in Germany during WWII. After WWI, he was an apologist for the nazi party, defending them by saying that they weren't that bad, and that they just wanted to preserve German culture. The world of German culture was very valuable to him, and thats what the Nazis wanted to celebrate.
<div class="break"></div>
<p>Heidegger doesn't necessarily ever talk about good/bad or right/wrong, so there seems to be a space in his thinking. He says that there are no objectively bad or good worlds; if you jump into a world and get satisfaction out of it, it's fine; likewise, if you don't, continue searching. He doesn't have the resources philosophically to say if worlds are good or bad, just to say how significant people find different worlds.</p>
<div class="break"></div>
<p>Germany obviously found the world of Nazism to be very meaningful, and then went on to preform the atrocities of WWII. Heidegger was simply silent in response to this. He doesn't know what to say about it, making the situation uncomfortable.</p>
</div>
<h2><anchor id="heidegger_enframing">&quot;Enframing&quot;</anchor></h2>
<p>An abstract force. In our case, its how we see the world when technology impacts our perspective on the world and our activities. The result of technology &quot;enframing&quot; us makes us only able to enjoy things that are able to be done quickly or that involve immediate gratification. &quot;We get into the habit of seeing things 'on call' or 'on reserve' for us to use efficiently, and when we turn away from that stuff and see something that <em>isn't</em> a resource, such as another person or situation, we still see it as on reserve for us to use.&quot;</p>
<!-- @todo may need to fix this up -->
<p>A good way of thinking about it is in the lens (lol) of &quot;enframing glasses&quot;; glasses that hide important aspects of reality. When worn, you can't see aspects of people, situations, objects, worlds, etc. that may be important. It's important to take them off once and a while; lest, we'll forget they're even on.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Golfball glasses&quot;, reveal golf balls in a field. Without them on, there are a lot of things we benefit by noticing and seeing easier, like sand traps and whatnot.</li>
</ul>
<p>Heidegger says that the more &quot;enframed&quot; we are, the less we'll see as valuable or sacred - theres less thats worth our time. Eventually, we'll get to a point where enframing holds <em>sway;</em> that is to say, its a force so powerful that it dictates how we see everything, and we wont even notice its going on.</p>
<p>A question is if Heidegger says <em>everyone</em> is enframed; if this is the case, then his view is implausible. He would admit that not everyone is enframed, and that this is merely a societal phenomenon.</p>
<h3><anchor id="heidegger_enframing_impact">Enframing's Impact on Humans</anchor></h3>
<p>Enframing is a real danger to what gets revealed to us. Theres an entire world of stuff to see, and theres only a small fraction being revealed to us - the stuff thats efficient.</p>
<h4 id="interactions-between-humans">Interactions between Humans</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skimming:</strong> We'll tend to not think deeply about others. Someone may say something we interpret as mean, and we'll call them a jerk, but we may not know the full story; perhaps they're working two jobs and not sleeping much. <em>We don't know the full story.</em></li>
<li><strong>Social Media:</strong> Social media allows us to get little &quot;quick fixes&quot; of adrenaline and the news of the world. This leads to a tremendous amount of division. Social media also leads to isolation; the more we react to social media, the more isolated we are.</li>
<li><strong>Human resources:</strong> We start to see humans as resources to be used. Mass mailings, robo-calls, even sites like <a href="https://mugshots.com">mugshots.com</a>, showing peoples mugshots for entertainment and profit.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="as-individuals">As Individuals</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skills:</strong> If a skill is no longer efficient to develop, it may not be practiced. Monotonous things, like remembering peoples phone numbers (&quot;its stored in my phone, why should I remember it?&quot;).</li>
<li><strong>Knowing ourselves:</strong> Now that we have all these distractions to which we can turn, we can forget about our self knowledge. If we had an issue in the past, we couldn't do anything other than try to fix it; it would &quot;stare us down&quot; perse. Now we can just distract ourselves by going onto our phones; its still there, but we may not have time to address it.</li>
<li><strong>Knowing (and being known by) others:</strong> See skimming. Not only are we skimming others, but others are skimming <em>us;</em> we/they may not see our/their most striking or prominent features.</li>

Heidegger says that whenever we're using technology or machines, it has a <em>constant negative impact on us.</em> We're getting into the habit of geting used to efficiency; even if we aren't using them, we get used to their impact and see other things as resource to use.
<div class="break"></div>
<p>&quot;Enframing <em>pounces upon us</em> and makes us 'see the real' in one very limited way; as <strong>resources</strong>,  or standing reserve, to be used efficiently and quickly, for purposes of immediate gratification.&quot;</p>
</div>
<p>In the end, its up to us to &quot;save&quot; ourselves to this; we need to develop the skill of patience. There are certain movements in the world that embrace the idea of techne, such as the &quot;slow foods&quot; movement where you spend an entire afternoon cooking or making food, or the fine arts.</p>
<h2><anchor id="heidegger_freedom">Heidegger on Freedom</anchor></h2>
<p>Heidegger says that instead of the <em>essence</em> of freedom (to Sartre: the ability to choose one thing over another at any given moment), the most important part of freedom is to have things <strong>revealed</strong> to us; to be able to see more things as options. Not only that, but to see those options in <em>totality;</em> not just as cookie cutter objects.</p>
<p>For example, if we had a chance to freely choose between three options and eleven options, we are more free by choosing between eleven. Heidegger says that the less options we see, the more &quot;enframed&quot; we are.</p>
<h2><anchor id="heidegger_objections">Objections to Heidegger</anchor></h2>
<p><strong>&quot;Everyone is worried about the impact of technology, but the cerns don't pan out. The printing press, the telephone, the television...&quot;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is true, but this is a misrepresentation of his view. As certain technologies has gotten more advanced, these conerns have panned out; for example, as the TV became a thing, people would sit on their porches and talk to their neighbors less and sit inside and watch TV more.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&quot;Is it really a good idea to return to the 'good old days' of no technology?&quot;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This again misrepresents his view. He thinks the convenience is great, but the past has something that we don't necessarily have: techne.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&quot;There are other enframers, or things that grab ahold of our perspective, limit our vision and what we notice; religion, politics, science sports, etc...&quot;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sure, but Heidegger is talking about technology limiting our perspective specifically. He says that this is something that needs to be discussed seperately, as it is a very dangerous force and enframer. It is all encompasing and comprehensive, perse; the enframing of technology impacts everything that we see and do, every interaction we have, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&quot;Even if Heideger is right, and we want to be quick and impatient, isn't that <em>our</em> right? In suggesting that we should enjoy slow activities and never skim people/objects/situations/worlds, isn't that just Heidegger bossing us around and trying to limit our freedom?&quot;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Heidegger says that if we become unenframed, and we're able to notice worlds that are slow aswell as worlds that are fast, and we <em>choose</em> the world of speed, he has no problem with you; you have free choice, you had the options, and you chose what you chose.</li>
<li>That said, he worries that the situation we're in is different. The enframed person does not consider all of the options (fast and slow); they only consider a few options that involve speed and immediate gratification. They can't see the full, slow worlds.</li>

<h1><anchor id="epictetus">Epictetus</anchor></h1>
<p>Lived in the roman empire, pretty popular. Walked around and discussed his theory. Didn't publish anything, but his followers took notes from his beliefs and those notes eventually went into The Handbook.</p>
<h2><anchor id="epictetus_handbook">Beliefs (The Handbook)</anchor></h2>
<ul>
<li>There are things that are not up to us, and they happen on their own schedule. Likewise, there are things that <em>are</em> up to us. Its important to distinguish these two facts apart.
<ul>
<li>Things like opinions, impulses, desires, aversions, etc. are up to us (perhaps not immediately; like Frankfurt, we can develop things like our desires).</li>
<li>Things like our bodies (not entirely), posessions, reputations, are NOT up to us.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Epictetus says <em>our happiness is a function based on what we desire.</em> When we desire something, we have an image of what we want things to be; when we satisfy that desire, we are fulfilled because the image pans out and matches to our reality.
<ul>
<li>Likewise, with an aversion, we have an image of how we DON'T want things to go. We are averse to when things don't match our desires.</li>
<li>Someone who successfully gets their desires is fulfilled, someone who unsuccessfully gets their desires is unfulfilled (unfortunate).</li>
<li>If something we desire isn't up to us, and it goes the wrong way, its obviously frustrating. But, there are two options.
<ol>
<li>Fight the world; change the external world and our surroundings to make these things happen differently (good luck, pal).</li>
<li>Change our internal world; change our desires and aversions to make how we want things to go match the way things actually go.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>There are two options for fulfillment;
<ol>
<li>Increase the number of our desires that are satisfied.</li>
<li>Decrease the number of unrealistic desires.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><em>&quot;Do not seek to have events happen as you want them to, but instead want them to happen as they do happen, and your life will go well.&quot;</em>
<ul>
<li>In other words, if you want to be satisfied, have realistic expectations. While we may wish for things to have gone another way, we benefit from having a more realistic conception of the situation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When we make predictions about life, we are basing the predictions on <em>incomplete information</em> - we don't know the exact information about many physical forces around us.</p>
<details>
<summary><strong>Old Notes</strong></summary>
<div class="note blue">
For example, say we're driving around Iowa City looking for a parking spot. If we pull in to a spot we think is available, and see that the parking meter has the dreaded orange cover on it (denoting its for construction/city workers), we may get upset. Epictetus would say that the "possibility" of that spot being available was never a real possibility; its fictional, made up, something thats in our head because of our <em>limited information.</em> We may pull in and be frustrated for a little bit, but Epictetus would say to think wisely and to say something along the lines of "this makes sense because the construction workers would need this spot, it would be really bad if they didn't have it" or something. This would leave us without anger; perhaps even content with life. This is stupid, I'm tired. 
</div>
</details>
<div class="break"></div>
<p>A perhaps better example is that <em>people can only act in the light of how things appear to them;</em> that is to say, people only act how they believe its appropriate to act. If people are getting us upset or acting otherwise irrationally, we can only assume that the world appears different to them than to us. A simple idea, but pretty profound. &quot;People act in the light of how things appear to them.&quot;</p>
<p>In a short sentence, through all of this, Epictetus is talking about the <abbr title="the branch of philosophy that studies concepts such as existence, being, becoming, and reality">ontology</abbr> of possibility. &quot;What upsets people is not things themselves, but the judgement of things.&quot;</p>
<h2><anchor id="epictetus_stoicism">Stoicism</anchor></h2>
<p>Stoicism is the endurance of pain or hardship without the display of feelings and without complaint.</p>
<p>There are some benefits to a stoic perspective;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Satisfaction:</strong> If you become a stoic, the only desires you have are the way things happen the way in they infact, so you'll be satisfied all the time. You may be frustrated for a second, but you'll soon see why your hope was unrealistic or even impossible.</li>
<li><strong>Tranquility:</strong> We won't be discombobulated or upset very often. If we get a bad call by a referee in a game, we'll simply address the issue, see the solution, and move forward; perhaps even appreciate what happened.</li>
<li><strong>Invincibility and &quot;Cognitive Armor&quot;:</strong> We can face any situation and not get bent out of shape and remain calm. As stoics, we can enter contests and victory will be up to us. If things dont go the way we want, we can simply change our desire and be okay with what happens, perhaps even learn from it.</li>
<li><strong>More Risks:</strong> We can take more risks with more upsides. We often dont take risks because we see what could happen and we get worried about the frustration and our impact on our happiness. If we aren't afraid going in, we can try a bunch of stuff and come out satisfied.</li>
</ul>
<p>Epictetus says that if we're stoics, then frustration, disappointment, and fear will disappear almost immediately. A stoic attitude will benefit us in all facets of life.</p>
<p>Epictetus also says that its fine to have goals and whatnot, but when those things go badly, be stoic. This applies to your own strengths and weaknesses aswell. Being stoic in a shitty situation can allow us improved function.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Absolutely no frustration or dissatisfaction.</em> We'll even get some joy and satisfaction in understanding the world around us, seeing how things make sense.</li>
<li>Extreme Stoicism
<ul>
<li><strong>Total detatchment:</strong> If a loved one dies, thats how that went, you couldn't control it, deal with it. We must be okay with <em>whatever</em> happens, and adjust to it.</li>
<li>^ ...instead of having desires, just moderate and weaken your desires until you don't have any anymore; you dont want anything to be any certain way, you're just okay with things as they happen.</li>
<li>Learn to understand what is happening in the natural world, adjust to &quot;the will of nature&quot;. The goal of the wisest stoic is to learn how to understand and follow nature, to have a detatched perspective, to observe and understand why everything happens.</li>
<li>
<div class="drone"><strong>Necessity:</strong> "Whoever has complied well with necessity is counted wise by us, and understands divine affairs." Meaning, theres only one thing that happens ever, so... We <em>need</em> to continue? Not sure what he means here.</div>
</li>
<li><strong>Third person view:</strong> There is no good or bad in nature, so nothing <em>truly bad</em> can happen. &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;, &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; are based on our expectations and frustrations.</li>
<li><strong>In defense of Extreme Epictetus</strong>
<ul>
<li>There is some satisfaction with understanding how things go.</li>
<li>Theres a historical notion between &quot;wanting something&quot; and &quot;lacking something&quot;; if we didn't <em>want</em> anything, then our lives wouldn't <em>lack</em> anything either. We would be complete.</li>

<h3><anchor id="epictetus_realm_extreme">Moderate</anchor></h3>
<p>&quot;Its important to have goals and ambitions and aims, but if we have those goals, don't get too bent out of shape if things go badly, so we can have energy to move ahead.&quot;</p>
<p>This is basically a rehash of above;</p>
<ul>
<li>Have desires and goals, be <em>connected</em> to others around you, but <em>know what you're getting into.</em></li>
<li>Don't get discombobulated when things run counter to plan; have a sense of what you're gonna get, and adjust and adapt around it.</li>
<li>Learn from experience; you will have a better chance of making things go better the next time. If you go into a job interview, bomb it, and then do the same thing the next time expecting something different, you won't have any success.</li>

<h1><anchor id="nagel">Thomas Nagel</anchor></h1>
<p>Wrote the paper &quot;The Absurd&quot;, answering the question if human life is &quot;absurd&quot;, or if it is meaningless or pointless.</p>
<h2><anchor id="definitions">Definitions of Absurd</anchor></h2>
<p>Originally, Nagel attempts to answer if life is <em>absurd<sub>1</sub></em>, but he eventually goes after if life is <em>absurd<sub>2</sub>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Absurd<sub>1</sub></strong> - Is human life absurd in the sense that it is meaningless or pointless? This is usually what we have in mind when we ask if human life is absurd, but this question does not get answered for the bulk of the paper.</p>
<div class="break"></div>
<p><strong>Absurd<sub>2</sub></strong> - Is human life absurd in the sense that humans comical, silly creatures? <em>Nagel says theres a lot of value in realizing this.</em></p>
<h2><anchor id="nagel_paper">The Paper</anchor></h2>
<p>In the paper, he attempts to answer the question for a little bit, but ultimately argues that if we think about it, we dont have the resources to answer that question with any confidence, so its a waste of time to even try.</p>
<p>The paper begins with three really bad arguemts for the view that life is pointless and has no value; he believes these arguments are common. These arguments aren't particularly good, for a number of reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No one is going to care what we do in a million years.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Who cares? What people do in a million years is not relevant; if theres no such thing as objective value, then these future people are mistaken in thinking that what we do matters (whether they think this or not).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Our lives are finite and short</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Perhaps the most common of these arguments. Making our lives longer would not necessarily give it any <em>more</em> value. It would perhaps be even <em>worse</em> to live a longer life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>All justifications about value come to an end.</strong>
<ul>
<li>After a certain time, no more justifications are needed for value; for example, no further justification is needed to take asprin if you have a headache.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><anchor id="nagel_absurdity_2">Absurdity<sub>2</sub></anchor></h2>
<p>Human beings are comical creatures; when there is a conspicuous discrepency between pretense, aspiration, and reality.</p>
<details>
<summary><strong>Old Notes</strong></summary>
Mostly supplementary.
<div class="note blue">
Human beings have many firmly held beliefs; abortion, gun control, etc... When we have these beliefs, our confidence level in them is at 100%. He then asks about the <em>proof</em> we have that these beliefs are true - in many cases, we don't have such. Instead of offering proof, we may restate our position, or state our position louder ("dont you see that its obvious?").
<div class="break"></div>
<p>There are some beliefs that we hold very dearly - they are foundational, per se - but they themselves <em>dont have foundation to be supported on.</em> And Nagel thinks thats interesting; he wants to highlight that we as humans concieve ourselves a certain way as homosapiens. We see ourselves as more exalted, as more &quot;special&quot; than any other monkey, as someone who has more reason than any other monkey. But when you actually look into it more, we probably <em>aren't</em> creatures who have proof of our fundamental views; we simply act on instinct. This makes us &quot;comical&quot; and absurd<sub>2</sub>, per se.</p>
<div class="break"></div>
<p>Nagel says that a prime example where we find this gap is the seriousness with which we take our pursuits and our proof that they amount to everything; &quot;the collision between the seriousness with which we take our lives and the perpetual possibility of regarding everything about which we are serious as arbitrary...&quot;</p>
</div>
</details>
<div class="break"></div>
<p>Most of the time, when we're living our lives, we take our pursuits very seriously - we have full confidence that they are important, at least we live that way. We choose them over others because we think they area important. &quot;We live as though we are certain (burying live puppies is wrong, humans are more valuable than rocks).&quot; But Nagel asks, <em>do we have any proof?</em> In the end, we don't. We can create proof for <em>some</em> of our beliefs, but we'll eventually lead ourselves to a foundational belief that we cannot proof. In that case, we can only argue pound our fists and say otherwise. &quot;We parade around as if we are homo sapiens, when in fact we are not.&quot;</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="The Outsiders/Detatched Perspective">Sub specie aeternitatis</abbr></strong> – If we take an outsiders or otherwise detatched perspective, we find out there is no proof to our beliefs. If we were rational animals, we would give up those beliefs, or atleast weaken them.</p>
<p><strong>There is a conscious gap between the way that we parade around as homo sapiens and the fact that we have little proof for our beliefs.</strong> When its brought up, we recognize it immediately. Still, we continue to hold onto our most fundamental beliefs - we reveal that we are not in facts homo sapiens, we do not require reasons or evidence for most of our beliefs. Then what do we do? We simply (perhaps stubbornly) parade around as homo sapiens again, disagreeing with others as though we are clearly right and they are clearly wrong. <span class="highlight">There is a constant discrepancy between pretension or aspiration and reality - that is to say, we think of ourselves as homo sapiens even though we are not, we think of ourselves as having evidence for our views when we do not. There is no proof or evidence for any value. <strong>We are <em>not</em> in fact homo sapiens or rational animals; we are absurd and comical creatures.</strong></span> <a href="#note_1">[1]</a></p>
<div class="note blue">
An important distiction is that the fact that we <em>don't</em> have proof or evidence for our beliefs does <strong>NOT</strong> make us absurd; it is the fact that we do not have proof and we parade around that our beliefs are so much better than others.
</div>
<p>Nagel writes this paper because he believes theres a real benefit to noticing that we are comical.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If we notice that we're comical and silly creatures, we'll be able to take ourselves less seriously.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Like stated above, it won't be 100% of the time, but just for a few moments (perhaps 2%) of the day. When we adopt this picture, we return to our lives as we must, but our seriousness &quot;is laced with a kind of irony and playfullness.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>There will be some conflict and compromise that will occur more often in our lives, to our own benefit.</strong>
<ul>
<li>A really good example of this is of the late, Notorious RBG and Antonin Scalia. They were diametrically opposed politicians; RBG was very liberally leaning, and Scalia was very conservative. Regardless, they were best friends; went to theatre, hung out, etc. In interviews, they have stated that &quot;if they decided not to get to know eachother based on 25% of their disagreements, they would miss out on the 75% that they have in common.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other reactions to realizing our absurdity, but this is the best one. Some other reactions to realizing our absurdity (these won't be productive or fruitful);</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We may try to forget that we noticed we were absurd.</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;The only way to avoid the relevant self-consciousness [of our absurdness] would be to never attain it or to forget it - neither of which can be achieved by the will.&quot;</em> — Thomas Nagel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>We could detatch; abandon our strong commitments, take the sub specie aeternitatis all the time. Perhaps even <em>insist</em> that our beliefs do not have any proof or evidence, and try to live under such dogmatic view.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Basically nihlism.</li>
<li>Nagel says that we can only take this perspective for a few moments; we will always have a perspective in which we are immersed in our pursuits. Even if people do try to take that perspective for longer, they have never really taken the perspective as they insist the perspective is true without any proof or evidence - you're back where you started.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>We could stop thinking of ourselves as homo sapiens.</strong>
<ul>
<li>We would simply slip back into our everyday ways into arguing and believing that our reasons are better than our opponents without any proof ourselves - back to square one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!--
### A Connection between Nagel and Frankfurt
Nagel says that 95% of the time we're in the heat of the moment, doing things, acting; we cant help but take that perspective (the desires that we act on autopilot). But there is the sub specius sdabnuisacbus perspective that we can take some of the time. Nagel says that by noticing that for a few moments a day or a week can be very helpful.

Frankfurt agrees that its important to step back every once and a while; in the heat of the moment, there may not be a whole lot to change our behavior, but outside of that time, for a few moments a day, we can take proactive steps and insert some changes into our daily routine. 
-->
<h2><anchor id="nagel_objections">Objections to Nagel</anchor></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Involvement in a larger enterprise - isn't that proof that our projects and pursuits matter?</strong>
<ul>
<li>That won't work. The idea of sub specie aeternitatis is comprehensive enough to consume these broader enterprises.</li>
<li>For example, if you step back and see humanity as a single being (sub specie aeternitatis), you cant point to or prove any value in humanity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Nagel seems to think that theres no danger stepping into the outsiders perspective, that we dont have any proof or evidence in our most fundamental beliefs - if for a few moments to use as a tool. But some would argue that it can be quite dangerous to induldge that perspective.</strong>
<ul>
<li>For example, some people may notice that their pursuits don't have value, and they lose attachment and commitment to those beliefs. Nagel thinks that this cant happen, but it can.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nagel thinks that if we take the sub specie aeternitas perspective for a few moments a day, we'll compromise more with our opponent, bracket our disagreement, and move onto other things to see where we can find some common ground. <strong>Is it really realistic to think we'll compromise more if we notice we're absurd in the Nagel sense all of the time (even in very serious conflicts)?</strong>
<ul>
<li>For example, a bunch of nicotine addicts trying to get their compatriots to quit smoking and hand over the cigarettes - only for them to smoke themselves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Does Nagels view undermine itself?</strong>
<ul>
<li>We dont have proof or evidence for our most fundamental commitments. Nagel offers an argument in his paper that we ought to accept, and in doing so he is contradicting himself; his view rests on other assumptions that cant be further defended.</li>
<li>Nagel would respond that &quot;we dont need to say that this is a valid argument or something that proves that huamns are comical or absurd; when we read through the argument, we <em>come to the belief</em> that we are comical and absurd, and when we come to this belief, we cannot forget it.&quot;</li>
